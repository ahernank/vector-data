## Study information

Adult mosquitoes were obtained by rearing larvae collected from breeding sites along the main roads connecting the municipalities of Kilamba-Kiaxi and Viana, Luanda province (-8.821, 13.291), in April/May 2009.
These are peri-urban areas where malaria reaches hyperendemic levels.
All specimens collected in the study area were typed as *An. coluzzii* {cite:p}`Fanello2002` although *An. melas* and *An. arabiensis* have also been recorded in the province {cite:p}`Cuamba2006,Calzetta2008`.
Specimens were stored on silica gel and DNA extraction was performed by a phenol-chloroform protocol described in {cite:t}`Donnelly1999`.
