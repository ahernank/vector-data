## Sample sets

* AG1000G-BF-A (in {doc}`Ag3 </ag3/intro>`)
* AG1000G-BF-B (in {doc}`Ag3 </ag3/intro>`)

## Study information

The Target Malaria project contributed samples from collections made in three villages separated by at most 30km: Bana (11.233, -4.472), Souroukoudinga (11.235, -4.535) and Pala (11.150, -4.235).
These collections were made in July-August 2012, July and October 2014, and January, February and April 2015.
The area is agricultural, with rice-growing areas near Bana and Souroukoudinga, and a large mango grove near Pala.
Female mosquitoes were collected by human landing catch, pyrethrum spray collection or aspiration.
Males were collected by swarm netting.
Both *An. gambiae* and *An. coluzzii* {cite:p}`Wilkins2006` were collected.
Specimens were stored in 80\% ethanol and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or using a simple CTAB method.
