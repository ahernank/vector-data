# Ag1000G partner studies

The Ag1000G project is coordinated by a consortium of partners from a range of different research institutions and countries.
This includes consortium members who are carrying out independent research studies in malaria endemic regions, and who have contributed mosquito specimens or mosquito DNA samples collected in the course of their own research.
This page describes the studies that have contributed samples to the Ag1000G project, which includes wild-caught samples from 19 African countries.
This page also provides information about the collection locations and methods, the people involved in the studies, and references to any published articles providing further information about the studies.

Throughout this page we use species nomenclature following {cite}`Coetzee2013`.
Unless otherwise stated, the DNA extraction method used for the collections described below was Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Science, MD, USA).

### Study information

Adult mosquitoes were obtained by rearing larvae collected from breeding sites along the main roads connecting the municipalities of Kilamba-Kiaxi and Viana, Luanda province (-8.821, 13.291), in April/May 2009.
These are peri-urban areas where malaria reaches hyperendemic levels.
All specimens collected in the study area were typed as *An. coluzzii* {cite}`Fanello2002` although *An. melas* and *An. arabiensis* have also been recorded in the province {cite}`Cuamba2006,Calzetta2008`.
Specimens were stored on silica gel and DNA extraction was performed by a phenol-chloroform protocol described in {cite}`Donnelly1999`.

### Study information

The Target Malaria project contributed samples from collections made in three villages separated by at most 30km: Bana (11.233, -4.472), Souroukoudinga (11.235, -4.535) and Pala (11.150, -4.235).
These collections were made in July-August 2012, July and October 2014, and January, February and April 2015.
The area is agricultural, with rice-growing areas near Bana and Souroukoudinga, and a large mango grove near Pala.
Female mosquitoes were collected by human landing catch, pyrethrum spray collection or aspiration.
Males were collected by swarm netting.
Both *An. gambiae* and *An. coluzzii* {cite}`Wilkins2006` were collected.
Specimens were stored in 80\% ethanol and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or using a simple CTAB method.

### Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the technicians of the Institute de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé/Target Malaria Burkina Faso, including Guel Hyacinthe, Diabate Brama, Ilboudo Seni, Kabre Rasmane, Diabate Noufou and Yeye Pascal, for their contributions to sample collections.
